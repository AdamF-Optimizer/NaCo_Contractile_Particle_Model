# Contractile Particle Model
This repo contains the CPM model as described in the paper "Continuous-space automaton model for pedestrian dynamics" by Gabriel Baglietto and Daniel R. Parisi, as well as modifications made to simulate some additional circumstances. The model is made with JavaScript in order to facilitate easy visualizations with HTML, without requiring the installation of any additional software. To run the simulation, open the `simulation.html` file in your web browser (only tested on Microsoft Edge) and click the start button.

Each version of the model contains comments in the code in the form of ``MODIFICATIONS`` comments, which explain what modifications are made and where, with respect to the previous version.
I.e., V2 contains comments about changes w.r.t. V1, V3 w.r.t. V2 etc...

The following model versions can be found in the following directories:
* V1: CPM_Targets
* V2: CPM_Targets_New_Movement
* V3: CPM_Targets_New_Movement_Death_with_Markers
* V4: CPM_Targets_New_Movement_Death_with_Markers_Population_Distributions

Each directory contains a README explaining the change made, along with images of the model: one at the start and one after running for a few seconds.
